# Personal Website ([nickcarchedi.com](https://nickcarchedi.com/))

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1fbdf24a-36a1-4fc5-9b7e-ce524ca375ef/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nickcarchedi/deploys)

This is my personal website. It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment.

## Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Create and run a production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
